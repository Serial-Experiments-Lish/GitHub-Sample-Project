# In the Beginning

In the beginning there was an HP Pavilion laptop.  And then I ascended into codehood.
Now, I code the laptop.  I am the 'master,' so to speak.  This laptop has become my tool.
For justice or for evil?  Only time & skill will tell.

# Hi Lishenga

Dell and Lenovo are better than HP.

## I Hope You Have a Great Day

_Mac is better too_

### Our Group is the Best

I enjoy working with you

#### Our Day is Almost Over

_Just a few more hours left in the day_!
